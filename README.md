# DataProject
First data project repository

1. Used Python and Pandas to aggregate the CSV data so that I can get the most popular item sold based on zip code and percentage of sales per store.

2. Used matplotlib and Tableau with the CSV file to present our Data.

3. Created a final Tableau dashboard visualization.
